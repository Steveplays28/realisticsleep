### Added

- Cauldron dripstone tick speedup
    - Uses the precipitation tick speed multiplier in the config
- Serverside translation support
    - Uses the [Server Translation API](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/Server-Translations)

### Fixed

- Cauldron precipitation not taking dripstone into account
    - Cauldron precipitation now checks if dripstone can drip into the cauldron
